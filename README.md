## Blackjack project

This is a blackjack website created using React.js along with separate HTML and Javascript

In Blackjack, everyone plays against the dealer. Jack, Queen, and King all have a value of 10, while aces can be counted as either 1 or 11.The object of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21. If a hand goes over 21, it is called a “bust” and the wager is lost. However, hitting exactly 21 is an automatic win. Players can either choose to "hit" and they will receive a card, or they can choose to "stand" in which they will not receive a card.# Blackjack
